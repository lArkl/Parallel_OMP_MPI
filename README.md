# Parallel Algorithms

This repo contains some of the algorithms and exercises as well as homework for the course CC301 - Parallel Algorithms.  
As you can see, the files are divided in various folders, being the main ones MPI and OMP. You can check some examples of MPI and OMP library usage with C/C++ and parallelization of certain algorithms like Montecarlo's approach to calculate Pi.


## Disclaimer:

As mentioned before, many files are from class so I'm not the owner of the whole. Nevertheless, I expect this to be useful as it was for me.
